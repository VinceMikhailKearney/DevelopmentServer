# LocalLeadersServer
A server developed in Django/Python that is hosted using Heroku. 
This server was used for the development of the LocalLeaders Android and iOS Apps.

Currently the dataset being used at OpenDataNI is returning an error:

http://data.niassembly.gov.uk/api/members/

Therefore, an older version has been added to the server and is returned when requested to allow the app to function.
