# LocalLeadersServer
A server developed in Django/Python that is hosted using Heroku. 
This server was used for the development of the LocalLeaders Android and iOS Apps.

Currently the dataset being used at OpenDataNI:

http://data.niassembly.gov.uk/api/members/

Is returning an error, so the MLAs are not being returned successfully - This hinders the performance of the apps.
